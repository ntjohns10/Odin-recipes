# Odin-recipes
Recipe Website
This is my first project in building a website.  I'm not entirely sure which direction I will go yet, but I think I will lean on my experience at The Grey and write a few of my favorite recipes that I picked up while working there.  After I have finished the project I will come back and edit the README to explain the final project.
