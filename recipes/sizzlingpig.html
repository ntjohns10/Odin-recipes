            <Strong>For the Pork</Strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 Bone-In Boston Pork Butt (About 6 Pounds)</li>
                    <li>1 Tablespoon Peanut Oil</li>
                    <li>1 Farm Fresh Egg</li>
                </ul>

            <Strong>Make the Pork</Strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grind the peppercorns and the mustard seeds in a spice grinder</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, miz the ground peper and mustard with the brown sugar, salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, and cayenne.  Set aside</li>
                    <li>Rub down the pork butt with the rub, let rest overnight in the fridge, wrapped in butcher paper.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 300 F</li>
                    <li>Wrap the pork in foil and bake for 8 hours.  Check that the meat is fork tender, it should pull away easily from the bone.  If it does not, continue to cook until it is falling off of the bone. Save the cooking liquid.</li>
                    <li>When the pork is cool enough to handle, shred the pork and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 325 F</li>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet until it smokes</li>
                    <li>Add about 1/4 cup of the reserved cooking liquid and 2 cups of the shredded meat.  Cook for 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Create a hole in the middle of the meat and crack the egg into the hole.  Pop the skillet in the oven and cook for about 3 minutes, or until the egg whites are cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Remove the skillet from the oven and garnish with parsley.  Serve family style with slices of white bread, inviting people to break the egg yoke and mop up the juices.</li>
