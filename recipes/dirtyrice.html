                Dirty rice is a Southern staple.  Historically made as a catch all for whatever bits and pieces may be leftover in the fridge, this dish serves as a sort of southern fried rice.  Dirty rice can be made with any protein to become a one pot meal.  Note that the chicken livers must be soaked overnight, don't forget to plan ahead!
